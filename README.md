# <Refactor-Code>

## Description

My primary reason for this project was to help undertstand the process of designing a website with the use of HTML and CSS. I aimed to refactor the code to help create a readable, and understandable source of information. This is because, the code I was originally introduced to, albeit effectively deployed a website; it was not very palatable to read therefore could create issues when it comes to making adjustments. I learnt many things in the process, such as: how to refactor code for it to make more sense for developers. I also learn to to use CSS to make adjustments to the code, but at the same time not have any significant impact on the actual website once deployed.
